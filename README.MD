# Parent Zone Technical Task

Following an interview with Alex and Yasmin from Parent Zone on 23rd of March, 2022, I was given a technical task.

## Task Details

- Create a form with 5-10 different user input fields including validation for registration purposes, including a submission button.

- Save the data via a query to the backend.

- Include a button to view and export the results of all submissions.

- Add a filter option to aforementioned results.

- The way the task is written, it sounds like it's preferable to write it from scratch using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. Therefore, no frameworks, good old vanilla.

## Usage

- Create MySQL database and table called parentzone and registrants respectively. Contents of this database are found in parentzone.sql.

- Modify register.php and userlist.php to include the MySQL database passwords for connections.

- View the PHP files via a MySQL-enabled web server and hopefully everything should work.
